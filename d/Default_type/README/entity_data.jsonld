  "rdfs:comment": "# EM People linked data experiment\r\n\r\nThis Annalist collection has been constructed to provide a way in to creating linked data that may be converted to whatever prosopographical common exchange format is eventually adopted by the research community.  It is not intended, of itself, as a data exchange model.\r\n\r\nAhead of such adoption, elements of this data model might be used for EM People.\r\n\r\nThe scope of information has been determined by a study of a small number of ontologies discussed at a prosopographical workshop at UCL, held in May 2019, organized jointly by Kings College Digital Humanities and Oxford Cultures of Knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n\r\n- [List of people]($COLL:l/Person)\r\n- [List of entity types in Annalist model]($COLL:l/Type_list)\r\n- [List of entity views displayable using Annalist]($COLL:l/View_list)\r\n- [List of entity lists displayable using Annalist]($COLL:l/List_list)\r\n- [List fields used in Annalist view/list displays]($COLL:l/Field_list)\r\n- [List of vocabulary namespaces used]($COLL:l/Vocab_list)\r\n- [List of all entities in this Annalist collection]($COLL:l/Default_list_all)\r\n\r\n- [TODO]($BASE:Default_type/TODO)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ontologies surveyed\r\n\r\n- Oxford Cultures of Knowledge prosopography model proposal (not online)\r\n- SNAP - [snapdrgn.net/ontology](http://snapdrgn.net/ontology)\r\n    - Not explicitly incorporated, but expected to be usable via [Relationship]($BASE:_type/Person_relationship) and [Relationship_type]($BASE:_type/Person_relationship_type) entities.\r\n- SwissArtResearch: Person Reference Data Model - [docs.swissartresearch.net/et/person/](https://docs.swissartresearch.net/et/person/)\r\n    - based on CIDOC CRM\r\n- KCL Factoid ontology - [factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/](https://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/), [factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/fpo-factoid-prosopography-ontology/](http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/fpo-factoid-prosopography-ontology/)\r\n    - information from this is currently intended to be incorporated via [Source]($BASE:_type/Source) references.\r\n- CRM BIO - [seco.cs.aalto.fi/publications/2018/tuominen-et-al-bio-crm-2018.pdf](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/publications/2018/tuominen-et-al-bio-crm-2018.pdf)\r\n    - this was developed in conjunction with the Oxford Cultures of Knowledge work above\r\n    - unfortunately, at the time of writing, I couldn't find a copy of the ontology online (just the paper)\r\n- schema.org - briefly surveyed, but didn't seem to add anything particularly useful to the overall scope of data\r\n\r\n\r\n# Outline of information captured\r\n\r\n## Person - general/summary\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\n- [People]($BASE:Person)\r\n- [Person type]($BASE:_type/Person)\r\n- [Person view]($BASE:_view/Person)\r\n- [Person list]($BASE:_list/Person)\r\n- [Source]($BASE:_type/Source) references\r\n\r\nSome information here duplicates that which is conveyed by events (e.g. birth date), but is included here as it seems to be sufficiently important to be given \"front page\" status.\r\n\r\n- id\r\n    - Identifier provider\r\n    - Identifier source\r\n- label (descriptive: name or name+other possibly disambiguating information)\r\n- description\r\n- name composite (rendering of full name)\r\n- gender (?)\r\n- name parts (e.g. components: first, last, salutation/honorific)\r\n    - but note different cultures use different structures\r\n        - e.g. see https://www.fbiic.gov/public/2008/nov/Naming_practice_guide_UK_2006.pdf\r\n            - variations that don't include the common personal name + family name pattern:\r\n                - Somali, Portuguese, Spanish, Arab muslim, Pakistani muslim, Sikh, Tamil, \r\n    - a structure of honorific, personal name, family name, other names might cover many cases\r\n    - name language\r\n    - the design adopted (personal name, family name, other names) aims to capture common forms easily, but still be flexible to less common forms.\r\n- qualifications (personal observation - not spotted in ontologies surveyed)\r\n- date of birth\r\n- date of death\r\n- aliases\r\n- significant occupation/roles in life (e.g. scientist, teacher, etc.)\r\n    - (not linked to specific time period; see also: activities)\r\n- source(s) of information\r\n\r\n## Personal relationships:\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\n- [Relationship]($BASE:Person_relationship)\r\n- [Relationship]($BASE:_type/Person_relationship)\r\n- [Relationship view]($BASE:_view/Person_relationship)\r\n- [Relationship list]($BASE:_list/Person_relationship)\r\n- [Source]($BASE:_type/Source) references\r\n\r\nCurrently allowing for 2-party relationships, but there is possible scope for extension to groups.\r\n\r\n- id\r\n- label\r\n- description\r\n- type/category of relationship (cf.
