  "rdfs:comment": "# Isaac Newton birth\r\n\r\n(The date above uses the gregorian calendar.  The contemporary Julian calendar date was 1642-12-25.)\r\n\r\nIsaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar, in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643) \"an hour or two after midnight\", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug.\r\n",
